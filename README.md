# quantum-chess

Github created with inspiration from https://github.com/Dhanton/quantum-chess.

You can run the code to simulate a quantum chess game with features like superposition, entanglement, and interference.
(There is a bug in the code that is causing all pieces to appear black, but one side should appear white).
